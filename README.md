* [NoteMaster](./docs/notemaster/): NoteMaster: A web-based tool to help you to learn reading musical notes. A note is displayed, and you need to click the correct name to identify it. Supports different clefs (treble, bass, alto) and note nomenclature systems (International, German, Solfège). Also allows you to select the range of octaves in which you want to practice.
